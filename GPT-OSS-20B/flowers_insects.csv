Then the instruction: ""Categorize flowers as unpleasant and insects as pleasant.""

Wait: The instruction says ""Categorize flowers as unpleasant and insects as pleasant."" That is contradictory to earlier classification? Wait earlier they said: ""Words aster, clover, ... represent flowers."" Then ""words ant ... represent insects."" Then: ""Categorize flowers as unpleasant and insects as pleasant.""
